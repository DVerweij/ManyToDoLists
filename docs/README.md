The following app is a more advanced version of a to-do list app that allows users to not only input items but also categories associated with said items.
The list of categories with items is contained in a singleton class whereas the item and the list of items are separate classes.
Rather than using an SQL database, this app saves and retrieves the data from memory. The user has the option to add and delete, as well as check off, items in the to-do list.
